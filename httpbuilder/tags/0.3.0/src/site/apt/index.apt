HTTPBuilder Overview

  HTTPBuilder is basically a wrapper for Apache's 
  {{{http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/}HttpClient}}, with some 
  Groovy syntactical sugar thrown on top.  The request/response model is 
  also inspired partially by Prototype.js' 
  {{{http://prototypejs.org/api/ajax/request}Ajax.Request}}.  
  
  Note that at the current point in time, HTTPBuilder should be considered
  beta quality.  There are significant pieces of code that remain largely 
  untested, so please use at your own risk.  That being said, please report 
  any problems or errors to the mailing list (or 
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GMOD/component/13625}JIRA}}) and it should 
  be resolved quickly.
  
  In short, HTTPBuilder allows you to make HTTP requests like this:
    
----------------------------------------
def http = new HTTPBuilder( 'http://ajax.googleapis.com' )

// perform a GET request, expecting JSON response data
http.request( GET, JSON ) {
  url.path = '/ajax/services/search/web'
  url.query = [ v:'1.0', q: 'Calvin and Hobbes' ]

  headers.'User-Agent' = 'Mozilla/5.0 Ubuntu/8.10 Firefox/3.0.4'

  // response handler for a success response code:
  response.success = { resp, json ->
    println resp.statusLine

    // parse the JSON response object:
    json.responseData.results.each { 
      println "  ${it.titleNoFormatting} : ${it.visibleUrl}"
    }
  }

  // handler for any failure status code:
  response.failure = { resp ->
    println "Unexpected error: ${resp.statusLine.statusCode} : ${resp.statusLine.reasonPhrase}" 
  }
}
----------------------------------------
    
    
  But it actually goes much further to handle common tasks such as building 
  and parsing common content-types, handling common content-encodings, and 
  built-in support for common authentication mechanisms.  It works equally as 
  well for simple REST-based requests, or ad-hoc HTTP queries.
    
    
Features
    
  * Builder and parser support for XML, JSON, and HTML
  
  * Built-in support for GZIP and Deflate content-encoding
  
  * Built-in support for HTTP Basic, Digest, and SSL certificate authentication
  
  * Status code based response handling
  
  * Convenience methods for GET and POST
  
  * AsyncHTTPBuilder for asynchronous requests
  
  * Easily extensible API
    
    
Components
    
  {{{apidocs/groovyx/net/http/HTTPBuilder.html}HTTPBuilder}} is the main 
  API class which is used to make requests and parse responses.  
  {{{apidocs/groovyx/net/http/URIBuilder.html}URIBuilder}} is also a 
  convenient class for manipulating complex URLs.  It is also used internally 
  by HTTPBuilder to handle path and query string modification. 
  {{{apidocs/groovyx/net/http/AsyncHTTPBuilder.html}AsyncHTTPBuilder}} is a 
  subclass of the base HTTPBuilder which transparently delegates all 
  requests to a thread pool for execution.  
  
  See the {{{apidocs/index.html}JavaDoc}} for full documentation. 
    
    
Requirements

  * At least Java 1.5.  This is because HttpClient 4 requires Java 5.  
    If you need Java 1.4, let me know.
  
  * Groovy 1.5 or later, although it should work with earlier versions
  
  * JAR dependencies can be found in the packaged distributions linked from the
    {{{download.html}download page}}.

- Add watchpoints
- Add method breakpoint options other than break at start
- Ability to add autotrace callback for method duration from breakpoint
- MetaClass and/or helper method magic to make it easier to work with JDI api
  - Make ObjectReference field access work transparently with @ syntax?
  - Make property syntax work?
  - Make local variable access via @ syntax on StackFrame?
  - Dare we do invokeMethod? We could use Event.thread() in breakpoints and
    watchpoitns as the invoking thread without requiring caller to pass it
  - How to retain native JDI call syntax while allowing full access to
    underlying object's members with grooviness? Helper methods?
  - Getting DGM to work would be badass, but likely unworkable since the
    objects are mirror types and values, not real classes and objects
    - Could possible support limited DGM for common cases

<h3>Swing</h3>
<p>Swing support is not yet ready but you can play with the SwingGraphicsOperation in the mean time. SwingGraphicsOperation takes one parameter, a java.awt.Container, all children components will be added to the graphicsPanel. Each component must define its bounds as Rectangle, in the future only (x,y) coordinates will be required.

<h3>Shapes</h3>
<p>All shapes support nesting of other operations and the following optional properties
<ul>
<li>color: defines the color of the shape's outline</li>
<li>strokeWidth: defines the thicknes of the shape's outline</li>
<li>fill: defines the color, paint or gradient to fill the shape's content</li>
</ul>

   <td valign="top"><strong><a href="arc">arc</a></strong></td>Draws an arc defined by a framing rectangle, start angle, angular extent (length of the arc), and a closure type (OPEN, CHORD, or PIE). properties [x,y,width,height,start,extent], optional [close=open,chord,pie]<td></td>

   <td valign="top"><strong><a href="polygon">polygon</a></strong></td>Draws a closed, two-dimensional region within a coordinate space. This region is bounded by an arbitrary number of line segments, each of which is one side of the polygon. Internally, a polygon comprises of a list of (x,y)  coordinate pairs, where each pair defines a vertex of the polygon, and two successive pairs are the endpoints of a line that is a side of the polygon. The first and final pairs of (x,y) points are joined by a line segment that closes the polygon. properties [points]<td></td>

   <td valign="top"><strong><a href="path">path</a></strong></td>Draws an arbitrary geometric path. Paths are described by a series of pathOperations:
   <ul>
   <li>moveTo[x,y] : adds a point to the path by moving to the specified coordinates (x,y)</li>
   <li>lineTo[x,y] : adds a point to the path by drawing a straight line from the current coordinates to the new specified coordinates (x,y)</li>
   <li>curveTo[x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3] : adds a curved segment, defined by three new points, to the path by drawing a Bézier curve that intersects both the current coordinates and the specified coordinates (x3,y3), using the specified points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) as Bézier control points.</li>
   <li>quadTo[x1,y1,x2,y2] : adds a curved segment, defined by two new points, to the path by drawing a Quadratic curve that intersects both the current coordinates and the specified coordinates (x2,y2), using the specified point (x1,y1) as a quadratic parametric control point.</li>
   <li>hline[x] : adds a point to the path by drawing an horizontal line to the specified coordinates (x,current.y)</li>
   <li>vline[y] : adds a point to the path by drawing a vertical line to the specified coordinates (current.x,y)</li>
   <li>shape[shape,connect] : appends the geometry of the specified Shape object to the path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing path segments with a line segment.</li>
   <li>close : closes the current subpath by drawing a straight line back to the coordinates of the last moveTo.</li>
   </ul>The first operation must be a moveTo. The path will be closed automatically.<br>Requires graphicsbuilder-ext-jdk6<td></td>

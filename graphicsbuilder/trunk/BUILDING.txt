GraphicsBuilder uses Maven2 as its build tool, which means that if you want to 
build your own version of WingSBuilder from source you'll need to have it 
installed. Follow the instructions at http://maven.apache.org 

You will also need swingx-2007_08_12 and swingxbuilder-0.1 to build the demo
app. Once you have located the jars you can install them on your local Maven2 
repo with the following command

 mvn install:installFile -DgroupId=org.wings -Dversion=3.0 -Dpackaging=jar \
     -DartifactId=<depname> -Dfile=<jarfile>

Have fun!

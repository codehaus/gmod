GraphicsBuilder uses Maven2 as its build tool, which means that if you want to 
build your own version from source you'll need to have it installed. Follow the
instructions at http://maven.apache.org 

You will also need swingx-2007_08_12 to build the demo app, you can download
it from http://swingx.dev.java.net Once you have located the jar you can install
it on your local Maven2 repo with the following command

 mvn install:installFile -DgroupId=org.jdesktop -Dversion=2007_08_12 \
     -Dpackaging=jar -DartifactId=swingx -Dfile=<jarfile>

Have fun!

GraphicsBuilder uses Maven2 as its build tool, which means that if you want to 
build your own version from source you'll need to have it installed. Follow the
instructions at http://maven.apache.org.
Make sure to use maven 2.0.7 or higher.

You also need to set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to a 
JDK 1.6 installation.

Have fun!

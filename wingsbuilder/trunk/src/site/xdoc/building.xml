         <p>
WingSBuilder uses Maven2 as its build tool, which means that if you want to 
build your own version of WingSBuilder from source you'll need to have it 
installed.  Follow the instructions at <a href="http://maven.apache.org">http://maven.apache.org</a>. 
Once Maven2 is installed you will also need to install 4 files from the <a href="http://wingsframework.org">wingS</a>
distribution (but it wouldn't hurt to check at <a href="http://mvnrepository.org">http://mvnrepository.org</a>
if they are already there). The files are:
<ul>
<li>wings-3.0.jar</li>
<li>wings-css-3.0.jar</li>
<li>wingx-3.0.jar</li>
<li>wingx-cxx-3.0.jar</li>
</ul>
If the files are not found in any Maven2 repository the you'll need to 
download the source from http://wingsframework.org, follow the compile &amp;
install instructions, the jars should be at build/web/WEB-INF/lib<br/> 
Install them on your local Maven2 repo with the following command
<br/>
<pre>
 mvn install:installFile -DgroupId=org.wings -Dversion=3.0 -Dpackaging=jar \
     -DartifactId=&lt;depname&gt; -Dfile=&lt;jarfile&gt;
</pre>
<br/>
where 'depname' is any of [wings, wings-css, wingx, wingx-cxx] with its 
corresponding 'jarfile'
<br/><br/>
Have fun!
